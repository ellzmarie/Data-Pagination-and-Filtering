# Unit 2: Data Pagination and Filtering
 In this project, I’ll use a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page. I’ll start with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. Then use my JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page and add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.  The application will need to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. The solutions need to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.  For this project, I’ll write code using plain JavaScript and will avoid using jQuery or any other libraries, plugins, or code snippets for any aspect of this project, including the pagination.
